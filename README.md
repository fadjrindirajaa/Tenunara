# Capstone Project (Tenunara)
## Hello Everyone! :wave:

This project is the final project or Capstone Project of the Bangkit Acedemy 2022 program by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka which I participated in during February to July 2022. In this project I acted as a Machine Learning Lead to lead the course of this project in the Machine Learning section of the application.

This application is an Android-based application designed to be able to detect the types of woven fabrics in Indonesia, besides that we also provide educational information about woven fabrics so that users can find out many things about the description of the types of woven fabrics in Indonesia. Therefore, we named this application Tenunara (Weaving Nusantara). This team consists of:

1. (Machine Learning) M2299F2581 - Fadjrin Diraja Muhammad - Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia
2. (Machine Learning) M7406X2973 - Maulia Savana Putri - STIS Statistics Polytechnic
3. (Machine Learning) M2004F0172 - Nadira Hanifah Nur'aini - Ten Institute of Technology November
4. (Mobile Development) A7224W2051- Figo Alsistani - UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta
5. (Mobile Development) A2152G1660 - Deliana Rahma Azahra - Bandung Institute of Technology
6. (Cloud Computing) C2183G1764 - Gunawan Prasetyo - Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta

In its implementation, we work together in designing this application between the Mobile Development, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing teams so that they can continue to coordinate to build this application.

In the Machine Learning section, we collect datasets from various sources that we get, so that we get image data for types of woven fabrics as follows:
1. Gringsing Weaving: 186 pictures
2. Weaving Palembang: 195 pictures
3. Weaving Rangrang NTB: 155 pictures
4. Weaving Ulos Ragigotang: 174 pictures
5. Sintang Dayak Ikat Weaving: 191 pictures
6. NTB Sasak Weaving: 216 pictures

Then, we built the Xception model which we think is suitable and appropriate for this project because it produces good accuracy compared to other models that we have tried as well.
